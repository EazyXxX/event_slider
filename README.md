A simple circle slider app that can showcase your data segmented into interactive points containing time period info.

### Project features

There may be from 2 to 6 time periods and the main circle block is independent from the other page logic (which means that 2 or more independent circle event blocks situated on one page are possible).

There are no UI libraries used in this project - only pure styled-components realization.

App's demo is hosted on Netlify => https://eventsslider.netlify.app/
